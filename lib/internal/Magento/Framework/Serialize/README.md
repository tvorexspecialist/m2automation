# Serialize

**Serialize** provides *SerializerInterface* and a few serializers to support different kinds of needs of serializing/unserializing of data. Here are list of serializers in this library:

 * **Json** (recommended) - It can be used to serialize string, integer, float, boolean, or array data to json string; it unserializes json string to string, integer, float, boolean, or array. This is the recommended serializer.
